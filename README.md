All issues or requests (Tickets) from customers are listed here. For example: "Payment failed", "Login problem", "Download error", etc. <br>
Each issue is tagged according to its importance: HIGH PRIORITY (needs immediate resolution), MEDIUM, and LOW PRIORITY. This helps the support team resolve the right issue first.<br>
Each ticket is shown with a status of "Open" or "Resolved." This lets team members know which issues are still unresolved.<br>
Each ticket shows the date the issue was created and which support agent has been assigned to resolve it.
